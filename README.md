# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
The task was to modify and add functionality to the PlanMyTrip App. Some of the
modifications include adding a weather description field to the weather data
that was already retrieved in the earlier module. Using user input statements to
filter the data for user preferences which will be used to identify potential
travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel
destinations, four were chosen to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google
Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities was created.
